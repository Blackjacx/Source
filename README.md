Tired of implementing the data sources over and over again? Want to use a lightweight solution that does not mess up your view controllers? Then this is for you! The generic data source implementation for all your view controllers, that supports UITableView, UICollectionView and NSFetchedResultsController.

## Installation

Source is compatible with `iOS 9.3` or higher and builds with `Xcode 9` and `Swift 4` syntax. You already use Swift 4? Then there waits the branch swift4 for you ðŸ’ª. The framework is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Source"
```
